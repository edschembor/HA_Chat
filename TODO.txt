TODO (In order of importance)
====

1) Get normal chat working across different servers
	->I think there is something weird with the lamport timestamps now
	->Debug: Print lamport received on each message received from a server, check insert()

2) Get unlikes working
	->Pretty much just copy like implementation
	
4) Merging
	->Currently, the merge method is VERY innefficient and 
	Yair would not be ammused by it.
	->Users currently in a chatroom is not dealt with at all 
	during merging yet
	->Deal with paritions during a merge (see design document)
	->Helper methods aleady exist
	
3) Get username working in send last 25
	->Currently, when a user joins a chatroom which has been running, that
	user will get the last 25 messages from the chatroom, but not who is 
	currently connected to it.

5) Deal with clients becoming partitioned from the server
	->See design document
	->Should be relatively easy with the code from Jeff's email
