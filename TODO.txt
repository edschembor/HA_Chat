TODO (In order of importance)
====

1) Get unlikes working
	->Pretty much just copy like implementation
	->Part is already implemented
	
2) Merging
	->Currently, the merge method is VERY innefficient and 
	Yair would not be ammused by it.
	->Users currently in a chatroom is not dealt with at all 
	during merging yet
	->Deal with paritions during a merge (see design document)
	->Helper methods aleady exist
	
3) Get username working in send last 25
	->Currently, when a user joins a chatroom which has been running, that
	user will get the last 25 messages from the chatroom, but not who is 
	currently connected to it.
	->Need to iterate through the user_list on the server and send the
	user joins to the new client
	
4) Client server partition
	->Does a server know which client was partitioned/left? 
	->Try ^C clients
	->PRETTY MUCH DONE -> 1 MORE CASE TO TEST
